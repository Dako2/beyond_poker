The objective of the game is to make the best 5-card hand possible using a combination of your two hole cards (private cards) and the five community cards (dealt face-up in the middle of the table).\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to playing Texas Hold'em Poker:\n\n1. Blinds: Two players at the table are designated as the small blind and the big blind. They are required to make forced bets before the cards are dealt.\n\n2. Hole Cards: Each player is dealt two private cards facing down, known as the hole cards",
